In a planet like Earth where Geo-Engineering occurs naturally through lavas, earth-quakes, Tsunamis, Cyclones etc etc, what do we need to be keep constant? What nutrients (bio-degradable wastes) can flow into the ocean? If we need to do geo-engineering to save the planet, what are the temeratures of the places that need to be? We are creating huge wind mills, large building etc etc, which effect the climate? Should we create a counter force for everything? The natural ones too? 

What if we can find solutions to counter effect which are cheap but cause someother impact? What is the thing which we need to keep constant? The answer is simple, the life, is the only thing we need to save.

The earth should be capable enough to sustain every being humans, bacteria, corals, fishes etc etc. So, it needs to create enough food for each of these beings. Now, even coming to this, should we let the dengue causing mosquitoes live? Here comes survial of fittest. This is too controvertial subject to deal with.

May be we should make the planet something like Japan where, people live in small compressed areas, like Tokyo leaving everything for Nature. Just to give you how good Japan is, Japan is as densely populated as India (336 in Japan vs 382 in India per sq. km) but has a forest area of around 67%. Then the problem statement becomes simple, the area we live shouldn't effect the other areas. But there are some complications, one being Japan is a developed country and can import the food it eats from other countries. Yeah, I am confused too. May be I'll get into this subject a little while later when it gets clear in my head.

Yeah, now I'm clear. The goal of Project Loops is simple. We should simulate the same change that a forest produces/the thing that used to there in the places we live and compress ourselves as much as possible. The driving force or the money required for this will be provided by Green Price. Like the same holds for the mountains we break to build roads or make buildings or granite floors etc etc. It is a big aim for someone as small as us. But we should AIM high.
