In this blog post, I would like to discuss two important things.
1. Why CO2 needs to be sucked?
2. Sucking CO2 out.

> [Plants don't reduce CO2. They just save CO2. CO2 consumed through photosynthesis is approximately equal to CO2 produced by Plant Respiration, Litterfall and Soil Respiration. The CO2 which we send into atmosphere through fossil fuels needs to be sent back.](http://globecarboncycle.unh.edu/CarbonPoolsFluxes.shtml)
> [As it happens, scientists already know how to pull CO2 out of the air. But the conventional wisdom holds that itâ€™s costly and impractical to do so.](http://amzn.in/f57Aobu)
