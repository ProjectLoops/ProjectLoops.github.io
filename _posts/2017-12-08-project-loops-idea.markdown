Today, we are using natural resources too heavily that even renewable resources are becoming non-renewable. Renewable resources have a maximum usage, exceeding this makes these resources non-renewable. Not only this, we are also polluting our planet with a lot of substances at a rate which is beyond earth’s ability to heal. The idea of Project Loops is to **loop the first (extraction) and last (disposal) step of industrial production** into our current economic system so that we can achieve sustainable development.

## Traditional Solutions
The current solutions involves making of new rules by Government and trying to make companies stop the production which costs a lot to the environment. But, this is not so successful as the Governments are get influenced by big companies and so government does a lot of favours to the companies instead of people. Even if the governments are ready to help people, governmental organizations are slow. 


> You have been negotiating all my life. The world’s governments have been talking about preventing climate change for more than two decades; they began negotiating the year that Anjali, then twenty-one years old, was born.

## The Whys
Most of the resources, we are using, are to make material products. Now if we see the price of a product, we don’t see the price of the natural resource we are using. For example, price of a book doesn’t generally include the cost to raise a tree because the company that produces the book gets it for free. This makes us or most of the people, not consider the natural resource that’s being depleted due to the products they are using. So, if the could make people realize how much/many natural resources they are depleting by using a product, we could make people use less products and save resources.
	Currently the price of products produced by companies which care about envirornment and natural resources is high. Thus there is a negative reinforcement for companies which care about envirornment.  

## Green Price

Green price tries to reward the companies which care about envirornment. The main idea is to include the price of recreating the natural resources it depleted. For example, if we are using a book, we would like to tag a green price, which shows the price required to regrow the trees which the book destroyed. Since we don’t want to force consumers to pay the green price, the consumers can choose between paying the Green Price or the traditional MRP (maximum retail price, a concept in India), the consumers will now get a sense of how much natural resources they are consuming by using this product and thus will try to reduce the usage of products which cause a lot of harm to the nature. Also, now the companies will try to reduce the Green Price because now people might consisder Green Price while buying products thus higher the green price lower the sales. 
> Global warming issue is because the current economic system is not adding the cost to dispose CO2 in the fossil fuels being sold. You take car to work may be, produce a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere and not pay anything to dispose it and then sit back and wait for governments to do something for global warming. Some people prefer the escapism and make themselves happy by thinking global warming/ climate change is a hoax. 

Also, we include the **costs to dispose the products** or the by-products which we get after using the products into the green price. For example, consider the case of using fossil fuel based vehicle. In this case, the user is disposing the wastes, CO2, SO2, NO2 etc into the air. Now, to purify the air polluted by these chemicals, we need some resources which have a price. This price will also be added to the Green Price of the product (Fossil fuel in this case).
> Thus, green price tries to use the disposals into the production step, thus **creating a loop**. Hence, the complete project is named as **Project Loops**
