##Problem Project Loops is trying to address
Today, we are using natural resources too heavily that even renewable resources are becoming non-renewable. Renewable resources have a maximum usage, exceeding this makes these resources non-renewable. Not only this, we are also polluting our planet with a lot of substances at a rate which is beyond earthâ€™s ability to heal. The idea of Project Loops is to **loop the first (extraction) and last (disposal) step of industrial production** into our current economic system so that we can achieve sustainable development.

## Traditional Solutions
The current solutions involves making of new rules by Government and trying to make companies stop the production which costs a lot to the environment. But, this is not so successful as the Governments are get influenced by big companies and so government does a lot of favours to the companies instead of people. Even if the governments are ready to help people, governmental organizations are slow.
