The city of Delhi is covered with huge amounts of smog during the winter and everyone knows it. The current majority of analysis sources are hinting towards colder weather, stagnant winds trapping the various sources of smoke. The primary sources of smoke are stubble burning, lit garbage, road dust, power plants, factories, and vehicles. Air quality can be measured by the amount of PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulates suspended in air. On Nov 7, 2017 the PM 2.5 levels in Delhi shot up to 999, much above the recommended 60 micrograms. At the same time PM 10 shot to 999 (the maximum level for the monitors), instead of the recommended limit of 100. 

In this blog post, I don't want to get into the details of the causes but tries to explain how the stubble burning problem is being solved currently. Here you could see how governmental organizations are slow.
