### **The solution briefly is pay 20 paisa more for 1 KG of rice produced from Punjab you consume as Green Price, we give the farmers the amount needed to dispose the staw.**

The city of Delhi is covered with huge amounts of smog during the winter and everyone knows it. The current majority of analysis sources are hinting towards colder weather, stagnant winds trapping the various sources of smoke. The primary sources of smoke are stubble burning, lit garbage, road dust, power plants, factories, and vehicles. Air quality can be measured by the amount of PM 2.5 and PM 10 particulates suspended in air. On Nov 7, 2017 the PM 2.5 levels in Delhi shot up to 999, much above the recommended 60 micrograms. At the same time PM 10 shot to 999 (the maximum level for the monitors), instead of the recommended limit of 100. 

In this blog post, I don't want to get into the details of the causes but try to explain how the stubble burning problem is being solved currently and slow governmental organizations are.

The following quotes are directly taken from [TheHindu article](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-flaming-fields-of-punjab/article19935665.ece)

> “To engage labour or machinery will cost me somewhere between Rs. 4,000 and 5,000 per acre, which I can’t afford.”, says another farmer.

Shouldn't the people who cosume the rice produced pay this? Green Price of rice produced here will have this cost of Rs. 4000-5000 per acre included. So, if people are using Green Price, they are providing the farmers the cost to use alternate practices to dispose the staw instead of burning them.

> “We have been providing machinery on subsidy, but even that puts an additional burden of around Rs. 3,000 per acre on farmers for paddy straw management,” Jasbir Singh Bains, director of the Punjab Agriculture Department.

> “Our fellow farmer is burning residue in the field. It’s not as though we are happy inhaling this smoke but we don’t have an option. Before this smoke reaches Delhi, it affects our health. We are with the government to find a solution, but a ban is not the answer.”

> “During the recent Assembly polls, all parties, including the Congress which was voted to power, promised to resolve our problems but now the government is itself aggravating them,” he grumbles. He says he will burn the residue in the next few days unless at least Rs. 5,000 per acre is given to him to dispose of the residue crop.

## Can fines solve it?

> "We don’t want confrontation, but if we are pushed, we will not sit quiet. Instead of asking us not to burn the residue, the State government should first fulfil its duty. As directed by the NGT, it should provide us machines and equipments.", says a farmer in Punjab.


Instead of relying on governmental organizations to solve this problem, **if you the Green Price of the rice you're consuming, we pay the farmers Rs. 5000 per acre and make sure that the staw is disposed correctly.** Thus, solving the problem.

## Reducing the green costs

> “We buy paddy straw (baled) from farmers to use it for generating power. We pay them Rs. 1,300 per tonne, but we can operate in a radius of not more than 45 km. Beyond that it is not economical for us to work,” says Ravinder Singh, plant manager at the Punjab Biomass Power Limited in Ghanour, Patiala.

Paying Green Prices, also helps to research in the fields of disposing etc, and can help in building more biomass power plants thus reducing the Green costs in the green price.
